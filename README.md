# APIs-4-Practice

This repository contains a simple Node.js RESTful API that I am actively working on and using for practice and development. The API allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of users.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
- `GET /api/users/:id`: Retrieve a user by their ID.
- `POST /api/users`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /api/users/:id`: Update a user by their ID.
- `DELETE /api/users/:id`: Delete a user by their ID.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ZedOps8/APIs-4-Practice.git

## Install dependencies
npm install

## Server
node app.js
